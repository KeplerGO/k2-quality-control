# TODO

Additional quality checks:
* Verify lightcurve and collatoral data files.
* Do the FLUXERR values make sense compared to sqrt(FLUX)?
* Reproduce lightcurve SAP flux by summing the FLUX from the TPFs.
* Reproduce uncertainties in lightcurve file from TPFs.
* Recalculate the background estimate from the raw data.
